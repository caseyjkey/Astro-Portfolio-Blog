I listen to SoundCloud throughout most of my day. Usually, I have been shuffling my likes, however, this was a huge gamble with over 2100 likes. So, I started removing my likes, and moving the tracks into playlists. Now my music is more predictable, and I can create set lists for DJing much easier (thanks Serato for your SoundCloud integration!).
